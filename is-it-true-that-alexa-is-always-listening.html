While on the call, the green light starts spinning until the call ends.</p><h2>Does Alexa report to the government?</h2>In response to this issue, an Amazon spokesperson said: “Amazon does not disclose customer information in response to government demands unless we're required to do so to comply with a legally valid and blinding order.<h2>Why does Alexa turn blue for no reason?</h2>It simply means that the smart speaker has heard your command and is currently processing it.
