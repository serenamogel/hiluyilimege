And it's expected to follow in the footsteps of the story established with Mass Effect Legendary Edition perhaps with some Mass Effect: Andromeda sprinkled in.<h2>Is Mass Effect 3 after Andromeda set?</h2>Andromeda is set some 600 years after Mass Effect 3, and interestingly you can even listen to voice recordings from Liara in Andromeda - given her long life span, it would also make sense for her to still be knocking around long after Shepard.<h2>Will Mass Effect 5 Continue from Andromeda?</h2>Mass Effect 5 will continue the epic story of Bioware's acclaimed trilogy of RPGs…and Mass Effect: Andromeda. It's fair to say that many fans, as well as the team at Bioware themselves, would probably rather forget about the fourth entry in the Mass Effect series.<h2>Is Mass Effect: Andromeda the 4th game?</h2>Mass Effect: Andromeda is an action role-playing video game developed by BioWare and published by Electronic Arts. The fourth major entry in the Mass Effect series, it was released in March 2017 for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One.<h2>Where is Mass Effect Andromeda 2?</h2><p></p><h2>Will Mass Effect 5 have Shepard?</h2>A product page suggesting Shepard might return was a "mistake," BioWare says. BioWare has responded to internet speculation that Commander Shepard will return in the next Mass Effect game, and it sounds like that is not going to be the case.<h2>Are there any male Asari?</h2>There is some conflicting information regarding the gender of the asari. Asari are a mono-gendered species with no concept of gender differences.<h2>Is Shepard alive?</h2>This line suggests, quite heavily, that Shepard is alive and working with the survivors of the reaper invasion. This is huge in terms of leaks for Mass Effect 5 – a game for which we have had no news in quite some time. 'MrHulthen' was also one of the first to break the story over on his YouTube page.<h2>Will there be a Mass Effect 4 with Shepard?</h2>Bioware developer Mike Gamble posted a statement on Twitter that seemed to indicate that Shepard isn't going to be in the game. He wrote: “Yeah, that was a mistake. Fixed.” He followed up by saying: “The original thing was written by the people who run the store and aren't familiar with the game.”<h2>Will Mass Effect 4 come?</h2>Mass Effect 4 is set to be the latest in the massively successful Bioware series, following on from the original trilogy of games on the Xbox 360 and PS3.<h2>Is Garrus in Mass Effect: Andromeda?</h2>While Garrus does not physically appear in Mass Effect: Andromeda, he is referenced briefly in passing. Through a sidequest, the player can unlock Alec Ryder's encrypted memories and observe a conversation between Alec Ryder and Castis Vakarian.<h2>Are Reapers in Mass Effect: Andromeda?</h2>Despite having the capacity and longevity to travel to and from intergalactic space, writer Mac Walters has revealed that there are no Reapers in the Andromeda Galaxy, the setting of BioWare's 2017 game Mass Effect: Andromeda.<h2>What happens if you tell Peebee you want strings?</h2>If you tell her you want strings attached, you won't have sex with her, and you'll instead take the relationship slow. The relationship with Peebee isn't finished. You can still strengthen your bond with her by carrying out her side missions.<h2>What will Dragon Age 4 be about?</h2>It looks like Dragon Age 4 takes place in Tevinter<p>One entry reads in-part: "the long-awaited follow-up to Dragon Age: Inquisition … will take players to Tevinter as the events of Inquisition and Trespasser threaten to forever change Thedas."</p><h2>Can Shepard survive me3?</h2>In almost every ending of Mass Effect 3, Shepard will die in exchange for stopping the Reapers. Both the “Control” and “Synthesis” endings will always lead to Shepard's death, as his consciousness will need to be infused into the Crucible for them to work.<h2>Is Shepard alive in mass effect Andromeda?</h2>While it would seem that Shepard sacrifices themselves to defeat the Reapers, the Destroy Ending (which appears to be Mass Effect 4 canon) has a scene suggesting they're alive. This isn't the only reference Mass Effect has made to Shepard's survival, but it is perhaps the most concrete.<h2>How old is Shepard?</h2>"Shepard was born on April 11, 2154," quoted from the resident article on Commander Shepard. The series begins in 2183, so Shepard 28/29 years old. Liara starts the series out at 106, which I've come to understand as relatable to be anywhere between 17-20 in human culture.<h2>Are there Quarians in Andromeda?</h2>Andromeda left the fan-favourite quarians out of the game to focus on Mass Effect's more prominent races. The quarians, Andromeda explained, were lagging behind on another ark ship - the Keelah Si'yah - with many of Mass Effect's other, more minor species: the drell, elcor, hanar and volus.<h2>Can the Geth survive the destroy ending?</h2>I always would go with the destroy ending to make sure the Reapers were gone and because Shepherd survives or is implied to survive. However it always kills me that EDI and the geth do not survive that ending.<h2>Can you save Anderson me3?</h2>You need to get at least 95% of your galaxy readiness. Without it, Shepard will not survive and Anderson will not live. you do not need 95% of galaxy readiness. No matter how many galaxy readiness, Shepard will die because each choice at the Crucible leads to death anyways.<h2>Are there female Salarians?</h2>Salarians are androgynous, and exhibit no major facial differences between males and females. Salarians are noted for their high-speed metabolism, which allows them to function on just one hour of sleep a day.<h2>How old is Peebee?</h2>Pelessaria B'Sayle, nicknamed Peebee, is an asari member of Ryder's squad. She is young for an asari, giving her age as "100 and change." A lone wolf and adventurer at heart, she originally came to Andromeda aboard the Nexus but quickly left and went adventuring on her own before encountering Ryder's team.<h2>Does asari get pregnant?</h2>Instead of trading cellular material directly like other biological organisms, asari reproduce by "melding": linking their nervous systems with their partner's using their biotic abilities and utilizing the electrical pattern of their partner's system to provide a template for half the DNA of their resulting child.<p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrTnqmvoZWsrrOxwGeaqKVfm66ye9aio6VlpJ2ys7GMm5xmmV2ism6tzZ2pqKWVma5ufg%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./are-pretzels-a-healthy-snack-for-weight-loss.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Are pretzels a healthy snack for weight loss?">&larr;
