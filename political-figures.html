She became a U.S. citizen in 2000 and in 2016 won a seat in the Minnesota House. In 2018, Omar was elected to represent Minnesota's 5th district in Congress. She became the first Somali American and one of the first two Muslim women in the U.S. House. She is also the first to legislate from the House floor while wearing the hijab. Omar is a progressive politician who is a member of Minnesota's Democratic-Farmer-Labor-Party. Her memoir, This is What America Looks Like: My Journey from Refugee to Congresswoman, was published in 2020.</p><h2 data-node-id=3 class="css-1a93ikt emevuu60">Early Life</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=4 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Omar was born on October 4, 1982, in Mogadishu, Somalia. Her mother passed away when Omar, the youngest of seven children, was 2. After this loss, her father, sisters and aunts took care of her. Omar grew up at her middle-class family's compound in Mogadishu, where her grandfather didn't enforce traditional gender roles.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Omar's childhood was upended by Somalia's civil war. When she was 8, her family fled the country. They ended up living at a refugee camp in Kenya for four years.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Omar and her family were granted asylum in the United States in 1995. The family first settled in Virginia, where Omar confronted bullies while attending middle school.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">When she arrived, Omar could read some English but couldn't speak it. One tool her family used to get up to speed conversationally was watching reruns of Baywatch.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Omar moved to Minnesota in 1997. Her family settled in the Cedar-Riverside neighborhood of Minneapolis, which is home to many Somali immigrants. Her father drove a taxi before getting a job with the post office. She became a U.S. citizen in 2000 at the age of 17.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Omar went to Minneapolis's Edison High School and graduated from North Dakota State University in 2011.</p><h2 data-node-id=12 class="css-1a93ikt emevuu60">Political career</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Omar's interest in politics was sparked by accompanying her grandfather to Democratic caucuses so she could be his interpreter. She later worked as a community organizer and volunteered on campaigns.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=14 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">In 2016, Omar unseated a 44-year incumbent in a Democratic primary and was subsequently elected to Minnesota's House of Representatives. Her campaign for this seat was covered in the documentary Time for Ilhan. Omar's win made her the first Somali American woman in the Minnesota House.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=15 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Omar was elected to the U.S. House in 2018 to represent Minnesota's 5th district, which contains most of the city of Minneapolis. Her positions include support for a $15 minimum wage, Medicare for All and the Green New Deal. She is the whip for the progressive caucus.

She has <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-features/ilhan-omar-congress-interview-797220/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=stated class="body-link css-1dhrel9 emevuu60">stated</a>, "I knew we had a responsibility to help shape a narrative about our faith that is positive."</p><h2 data-node-id=18 class="css-1a93ikt emevuu60">Attacks on Omar</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=19 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">While she was running for the Minnesota House, conservative sites and online forums spread a rumor that Omar had married her brother in order to help him immigrate to the United States.

In one instance, she was criticized for a February 2019 tweet that <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://time.com/5628844/ilhan-omar-profile/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=declared class="body-link css-1dhrel9 emevuu60">declared</a>, "It's all about the Benjamins, baby!" in regards to supporters of Israel in Congress.

After having two children together, daughter Isra and son Adnan, the couple's relationship deteriorated. They followed Islamic procedure to end the union in 2008 (they had not been legally married).</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=28 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Omar had trouble coping after the end of her marriage in 2008 and went so far as to<a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.twincities.com/2020/05/23/omar-describes-life-as-a-fearless-fighter-in-new-memoir/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=" shave her head" class="body-link css-1dhrel9 emevuu60"> shave her head</a>.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=29 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Omar eloped with British citizen Ahmed Nur Said Elmi in 2009.

Omar reconciled with Hirsi, with whom she had a third child, daughter Ilwad, in 2012. Though Omar remained legally married to Elmi, she filed joint tax returns with Hirsi in 2014 and '15. She later paid a fine and back taxes to rectify the matter.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=31 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">After legally divorcing Elmi, Omar legally wed Hirsi in January 2018.
