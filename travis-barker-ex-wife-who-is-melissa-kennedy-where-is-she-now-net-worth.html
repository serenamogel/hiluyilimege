She is a model, but is perhaps best known for being Jordan Belfort’s ex-wife.</p><p>Self-compassion is simply giving the same kindness to ourselves that we would give to others. When you are compassionate…</p><p>Posted by <a rel=nofollow href=#>Dr. Nadine Macaluso, Licensed Marriage and Family Therapist</a> on&nbsp;<a rel=nofollow href=#>Saturday, March 23, 2019</a></p><h2><span id=Early_life_and_education>Early life and education</span></h2><p>Nadine’s parents moved to Brooklyn, New York US when she was just a kid and she spent her entire childhood there. She doesn’t talk much about her parents so there is nothing known about them – she went to John Dewey High School in Brooklyn and attended Pacifica Graduate Institute with Masters in Clinical Psychology and got her PhD in 2015.</p><h2><span id=Career>Career</span></h2><p>Nadine began her career as a model when she became the poster girl of “Miller Lite” beer, and went on to appear in numerous national campaigns, but wasn’t nearly as famous as after she started dating Jordan Belfort. Her fame did not bring her much, since she stopped working as a model as soon as she married Jordan.</p><p>Ever since Nadine got her PhD in 2015, she’s been working as a marriage counselor and family therapist, going by the name Dr. Nadine Macaluso. She claims that ‘therapy is a path of self-discovery that can restore your connection to your authentic self so that you can feel fully alive and reach your potential.’</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/affairpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Nadine-Caridi-1-780x405.jpg><h2><span id=Personal_life>Personal life</span></h2><p>Nadine met Jordan during one of his parties and it was her then boyfriend <a rel=nofollow href=#>Alan Wilzig</a>, an American entrepreneur and a semi-professional race driver, who introduced the two – Jordan was famous back than for his parties which were filled with girls, alcohol and drugs. He was married to Deniso Lombardo at that time but was very attracted to Nadine and a couple of years after he divorced, he married Nadine in 1991. She then quit her modeling job, and has two children with him – a son named Carter and a daughter named Chandler.</p><p><a rel=nofollow href=#>Jordan</a> bought a luxurious yacht for his wife and named it “Nadine”, but it sank in June 1996. At that time, Jordan was often in the news because of his suspicious businesses, which led to an investigation by the authorities, and he ended up being sentenced to four years in prison in 2003 – he spent one year and 10 months in jail before release on probation for good behavior. This incident, together with Jordan’s addiction to alcohol and drugs, his affairs with other women and physical abuse towards Nadine, saw her decide to divorce him in 2005.</p><p>For everybody who is interested, there is a famous movie called “The Wolf of Wall Street” released on 25 September, 2007 which is based on Belfort’s life. The film starred Leonardo DiCaprio as Jordan and Margot Robbie as Nadine and was a major success, winning a couple of awards and is considered to be one of the best movies of that time.</p><p>After she divorced Jordan, Nadine married again, this time to John Macaluso who is an ex- entrepreneur and was a CEO of the Wizard World while he still has shares in the company which are worth around $8 million. It was not a problem for them that John was 22 years older and they seem to be living a happy life now. They don’t have any kids together, but Macaluso has three daughters from his first marriage, adding to Nadine’s two from hers.</p><p>Flashback to a photo shoot I did for The Hollywood Reporter. This was in Hermosa Beach a few years ago. Happy holidays to those celebrating and have a wonderful weekend, everyone.</p><p>Posted by <a rel=nofollow href=#>Jordan Belfort – Wolf of Wall Street</a> on&nbsp;<a rel=nofollow href=#>Friday, December 22, 2017</a></p><h2><span id=Jordan_Belfort>Jordan Belfort</span></h2><p>Jordan quit his life as a stockbroker after he got out of jail; he released his memoir <a rel=nofollow href=#>“The Wolf of the Wall Street”</a> in 2007 – the memoir on which the movie of the same name is based. In 2009 he published his second memoir “Catching the Wolf of Wall Street”, and both have been published in more than 40 countries, and translated into 18 languages.</p><p>Soon after Jordan published his second book, he started giving motivational speeches, which in the beginning were focused on motivation and ethics, after which he began talking about skills and entrepreneurship. He made a tour of live seminars throughout Australia called “The Truth Behind His Success”, and during one of his interviews, stated that the thing he regrets the most about his former life is that he lost a lot of other people’s money.</p><p>Even though Jordan claims to be working completely legitimately now, a lot of people don’t trust him and are reacting negatively to his speeches, especially to the parts in which he talks about his past actions which led to his arrest.</p><h2><span id=Nadines_hobbies_and_favorite_things>Nadine’s hobbies and favorite things</span></h2><p>Nadine talked about her favorite things to do and favorite actors to watch during one of her interviews – <a rel=nofollow href=#>Tom Hanks</a> and Sandra Bullock are always good for watching, her dream holiday destination are the mountains in Switzerland, and her favorite color is red. She has many hobbies which include painting, cooking, reading and travelling, while her favorite cuisine is Italian.</p><h2><span id=Appearance_and_net_worth>Appearance and net worth</span></h2><p>Nadine is currently 56 years old, has long blonde hair, blue eyes, is 5ft 8ins (1.78m) tall and weighs around 142lbs (64kg), with vital statistics of 36-30-37, and she wears shoes size seven.</p><p>Authoritative sources estimate Nadine’s net worth to be around $5 million, most of which she has earned from her career of a therapist.</p><h2><span id=Social_media_presence>Social media presence</span></h2><p>Nadine has her own <a rel=nofollow href=#>website</a> on which she offers her therapist services, while she also maintains her Instagram account which is followed by nearly 9,000 people and has more than 1,000 posts – she mostly publishes pictures with motivational quotes, and a lot of people have claimed that Nadine has helped them with their problems. She is also very active on her Twitter account which she opened in June 2012, but has less than 1,000 followers and around 1,000 tweets.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue8Snq56qpJa2r7nEp6torKKWw6q%2FjJuYq6OVp3qmxIywoJ%2BdXay1sHnIrGSmnZyewLStjKScp6aVmcZuw8eeqZ5lmah6tLTEZqWor12jsrV51qipraBf</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./catherine-disher-biography.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Catherine Disher  Bio (Wiki) ">&larr;
