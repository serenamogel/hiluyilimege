Cummings?</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=2 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">E.E. Cummings was an innovative poet known for his lack of stylistic and structural conformity, as seen in volumes like Tulips and Chimneys and XLI Poems. After self-publishing for much of his career, he eventually found wide recognition. A playwright and visual artist as well, Cummings died on September 3, 1962.</p><h2 data-node-id=3 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Early Life</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=4 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Edward Estlin Cummings was born on October 14, 1894, in Cambridge, Massachusetts. His father was a minister and professor, while his mother instilled in the youngster a love of language and play. Cummings went on to earn both his B.A. and his M.A. by 1916 from Harvard University, where his father taught, before going on to serve in <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.history.com/topics/world-war-i data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="World War I" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">World War I</a> overseas as a volunteer for the ambulance corps.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">A pacifist, Cummings was imprisoned for several months by French authorities for suspicion of treason due to letters he'd written. He later recounted his jail experiences in the autobiographical novel The Enormous Room, published in 1922.</p><h2 data-node-id=7 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Writings</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">His next book, Tulips and Chimneys (1923), was a collection of poems. He published a few more volumes of poetry in the 1920s and '30s. Cummings, who lived in Paris and New York, became known for poems that played wildly with form and spacing, punctuation, capitalization, overall grammar and pacing (a sample title of one of his poems: "the hours rise up putting off stars and it is"), perhaps serving as a structural metaphor for the writer's belief that much of modern society killed individual creativity and freedom.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Nonetheless, he was also able to write traditionally styled verse such as sonnets with a flair for wit and whimsy. Cummings' work was also known for its focus on nature, sexuality and love, in both a sensual and a spiritual sense.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Cummings wrote the avant-garde play Him, performed by the Provincetown Players in 1927, and a few years later traveled to the Soviet Union. Though curious, he was in fact put off by the government's social policies, which he wrote about with unconventional prose in his 1933 work Eimi.</p><h2 data-node-id=11 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Recognition</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Unable to find a publisher, Cummings self-published much of his work and struggled financially. It was only in the 1940s and '50s, with a burgeoning counterculture, that his style of writing came to be more favored by the masses and he gave live readings before full houses.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">He received a fellowship from the Academy of American Poets at the start of the 1950s. He later spoke about his work as part of Harvard's Charles Eliot Norton lecture series, presented in the 1953 book i: six nonlectures. Later in the decade, he won the Bollingen Prize for Poetry from Yale University.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=14 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Cummings was also a noted visual artist who presented one-man gallery showings. He was married three times.</p><h2 data-node-id=15 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Death and Literary Legacy</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=16 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Cummings died on September 3, 1962, in North Conway, New Hampshire, from a brain hemorrhage, leaving legions of poems as a literary legacy. An overview of his writing can be found in E.E. Cummings: Compete Poetry, 1904-1962, while other published volumes include Erotic Poems, The Early Poems of E.E. Cummings and Fairy Tales.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=17 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">There are several biographies available on the poet, including 2014's E.E. Cummings: A Life by Susan Cheever.</p><ul data-node-id=20 class="css-yzf9pi e1k3dme10"><li>Name: Edward Estlin Cummings</li><li>Birth Year: 1894</li><li>Birth date: October 14, 1894</li><li>Birth State: Massachusetts</li><li>Birth City: Cambridge</li><li>Birth Country: United States</li><li>Gender: Male</li><li>Best Known For: E.E.
