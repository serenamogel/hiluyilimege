A lot of people say that Goku can defeat Jotaro and Star Platinum, but then again, Goku is Universal in strength currently (Arguably stronger than that still!)<h2>Can Goku lift a mountain?</h2>Goku: base Goku has the power to carry 40 tonnes, and he can lift a mountain (a small one). In Super Saiayn 3 he has a power of N/A and he can carry over 40 tonnes which is enough to carry the weight of over 80'000 pounds (just like Buu but with much more difficulty).<h2>Can Goku stand on the sun?</h2>Assuming Goku can withstand the heat of the sun, physically he wouldn't be able to. The sun is a ball of gas. Can't be walked on any more than water can.<h2>Can Goku stay space?</h2>Goku has been able to survive in space since OG Dragon Ball. He went to the moon using his power poll and had no problem being in a vacuum.<h2>GOKU vs VEGETA, but this time they have STANDs</h2><p></p><h2>Can Goku survive lava?</h2>Goku can never be died falling into lava. Goku survived easily from that lava and he fought back with Frieza. If we consider that Goku died then why Shenron said that he was alive and couldn't be brought back to life because he already was alive while others was wishing to Shenron.<h2>What is Goku's greatest feat?</h2>Enter Ultra Instinct Goku. Jiren unwisely attacks the allies of Universe 7 and unleashes the rage of the most powerful form of Goku we've ever seen. What follows is a one-sided beatdown, where Goku proves to everyone watching the tournament, that he too has surpassed the power of the gods.<h2>Can Goku lift a solar system?</h2>Goku hasn't even been shown to lift a planet let alone multiple planets, stars, solar systems, galaxies, or universes.<h2>What is Goku's top speed?</h2>Dragon Ball Z: Kakarot estimates that Goku's power levels are around 10 billion as of the Babidi Saga. By applying the same formula, this means that Goku, without Instant Transmission, can travel 22.321 trillion MPH -- or 33,314 times the speed of light!<h2>Which is the strongest stand?</h2>1 The World Over Heaven<p>While technically non-canon, the World Over Heaven is still the most powerful Stand in the entire Jojo's Bizarre Adventure franchise. A variation of Dio's Stand The World, it serves an alternate version of Dio that successfully eliminated the Joestars and "obtained heaven".</p><h2>What is Goku's power level?</h2>Goku is able to fight Beerus while he is using 70% of his power. Goku admits that he was holding back at first only using 80% of his real power which would put Goku's battle power at 4.8 Quadrillion.<h2>Is Gold Experience Requiem stronger than Star Platinum?</h2>Sp is stronger and can move at the speed of light while ger holds a lot more power.<h2>Can D4C beat Ger?</h2>So GER has no choice but to just sit and do nothing because D4C will just camp in LT. The only way to defeat GER is to have an ability like WOU, be able to over right reality, or have an ability like Soft and wet.<h2>Can Tusk Act 4 beat Star Platinum?</h2>Literally look at the stats and there you go. Besides, Star Platinum has been said to exceed the speed of light, and Tusk Act 4 can't apply to that. So it's definite that Star Platinum is faster. Stop digging for evidence of speed in the manga, which keep in mind aren't in motion.<h2>Can Tusk Act 4 beat Ger?</h2>Also remember the fact that Johnny needs the rotational energy of a horse to use the infinite spin. So in this scenario, ger wins. Tusk would win because just like soft and wet, he can bypass cause and effect abilities. Soft and wet is able to bypass calamity which is a cause and affectability.<h2>Can Goku pick up Thor's hammer?</h2>Yes, Dragon Ball's Goku Could Lift Thor's Hammer, Mjolnir.<h2>Can Goku lift 200 quintillion tons?</h2>His max pL then was 180,000 when he fought Frieza his pL was 3 million. Roughly 16x higher, meaning he could theoretically lift 464 tons. But when Goku goes Kaiokenx20 his pL was 60 million, 20x more, meaning he could theoretically lift,9280 tons.<h2>What is Goku's battle IQ?</h2>Goku: 76, even though you might think his IQ could be even lower sometimes, he often proves he can do some smart things too, especially while fighting and especially during DBZ.<h2>What is Goku's greatest fear?</h2>1) Goku's fear of needles<p>His constant screaming and flailing required more than half a dozen people to hold him down. Eventually, Chi Chi comes in and, through her prodding at Goku's expense, reveals the Earth's hero is indeed afraid of needles.</p><h2>Can Goku destroy a sun?</h2>Yeah, probably not. Bro Goku is Star Level in Frieza Saga, Solar in Cell Saga, and Galaxy level in Buu Saga, what y'all mean burnt to a crisp. Just because he's powerful doesn't mean he can handle radiation.<h2>Is Goku immune to cold?</h2>At this point in the series Goku's body was not able to withstand the colds that it could later in the series, hinting at the thought that as a their skin strengthens, so does it's ability to insulate heat.<h2>Is Goku immune to poison?</h2>Goku is almost completely immune to poisons and toxins. In Jaco the Galactic Patrolman, Jaco carries around a small vial that holds a toxin so powerful it would apparently wipe out the human race if he opened it. But then he says it flat out wouldn't work on a saiyan, not even a baby saiyan like Kakarot.<h2>What versions of Superman can Goku beat?</h2>while goku is extremely powerful, he would not be able to even hurt superman whose only weakness is magic and kryptonite. goku cannot use magic and if anything, the ki blasts are a form of uv light which would help superman. the only way he could defeat superman would be with the powerpole.<p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrTnqmvoZWsrrOxwGeaqKVfm66ye8KapWafn6DCbr%2FEnmSaZaOprq%2Bw</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./enid-kent-net-worth-62063.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Enid Kent Net Worth">&larr;
