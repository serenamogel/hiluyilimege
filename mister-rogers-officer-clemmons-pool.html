This status was reflected at many community pools across the country, with white people preventing Black people from sharing the water with them. It was in this atmosphere that <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/movies-tv/fred-rogers data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Fred Rogers" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Fred Rogers</a> performed a simple but meaningful act in episode 1065 of Mister Rogers' Neighborhood, which aired on May 9, 1969. Rogers invited Officer Clemmons, a Black police officer on the show, to join him and cool his feet in a small plastic wading pool. When Clemmons sat down and placed his feet in the water, right next to Rogers', the two men broke a well-known color barrier.</p><h2 data-node-id=2 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Despite the Civil Rights Act of 1964, pools around the country were still segregated</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=3 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In the 20th century, many communities in the United States created pools for children and adults to swim and splash in. However, few of these spaces welcomed Black people. Many white people balked at the thought of unsegregated pools because they harbored the racist belief that African Americans were more likely to transmit disease. Pool-goers were also separated by color due to bigoted fears about the need to protect the virtue of white women from predatory Black men.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=5 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Segregation was the law throughout the South. And though northern locales often didn't have <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.history.com/topics/early-20th-century-us/jim-crow-laws data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Jim Crow statutes" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Jim Crow statutes</a> on the books, discriminatory behavior took place there as well. Segregation at pools was sometimes enforced by intimidation and violence, such as beating any Black swimmers who tried to go in the water.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Like buses and lunch counters, pools became a place of protest during the fight for civil rights. In 1964, a group of Black and white people jumped into a segregated pool at a motel in St. Augustine, Florida. This enraged the manager that he poured acid in the water (fortunately, the acid was diluted in the pool water and no one was injured).</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">The <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.history.com/topics/black-history/civil-rights-act data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Civil Rights Act of 1964" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Civil Rights Act of 1964</a> put an end to the sanctioned separation of different races in public areas. But many white people opposed desegregation, including at pools. In 1969, pools around the country were still shutting out Black people.</p><h2 data-node-id=8 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Mister Rogers and Officer Clemmons not only shared a pool but also a towel</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Rogers knew that pools continued to refuse entry to Black people in 1969 and that racial tensions were rising — <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/activists/martin-luther-king-jr data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Martin Luther King Jr." class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Martin Luther King Jr.</a> had been assassinated a year earlier. So he sent a deliberate message on the May 9, 1969, episode of Mister Rogers' Neighborhood. During the show, Rogers asked Officer Clemmons, a Black police officer played by François Clemmons, if he'd like to cool his feet with Rogers in a children's wading pool. Clemmons initially declined the invitation, noting he didn't have a towel — but Rogers said Clemmons could share his.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">The actions in episode 1065 weren't complex: two men took off their shoes and socks, rolled up their pants and then swished their feet together in a shallow pool on a hot day. But Rogers and Clemmons demonstrated that a Black man and a white one could peacefully share the water. When Clemmons had to go, he used Rogers' towel to dry his feet, as promised. Rogers left the pool directly after Clemmons and proceeded to use the same towel. Their casual intimacy exposed the bigotry of denying Black citizens access to pools, or any other place in society.</p><img alt="Mister Rogers and Officer Clemmons soaking their feet in a wading pool" title="Mister Rogers and Officer Clemmons soaking their feet in a wading pool" width=6568 height=4458 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/505322_fred_francois_pool_10_rc1526492878.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-eqbp25 eewc14j2">Photo: John Beale/Courtesy of Focus Features</span><p>Mister Rogers and Officer Clemmons cooling off their feet in a wading pool.</p><h2 data-node-id=14 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Clemmons hoped 'the world would change' after the episode</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=15 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">An episode of Mister Rogers' Neighborhood couldn't possibly erase the long history of discrimination in pools and elsewhere. But Rogers' actions were a step along the path toward Black and white people being free to splash, swim and live together. As Clemmons said to the <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.pghcitypaper.com/pittsburgh/how-fred-rogers-used-his-neighborhood-to-teach-important-often-radical-lessons/Content?oid=8718656" data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Pittsburgh City Paper" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Pittsburgh City Paper</a> in 2018, "I carried the hope inside of me that, one day, the world would change. And I do feel that the world still has not totally changed, but it is changing. We're getting there."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=16 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Rogers' own life demonstrates how attitudes can shift. In the 1960s and '70s he asked the gay Clemmons to keep his sexuality hidden for the sake of the show; Clemmons, understanding how widely homosexuality was condemned at the time, obeyed. However, Rogers personally came to accept Clemmons.</p><h2 data-node-id=17 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">The pair recreated the pool scene 24 years later</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=18 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Both Clemmons and Rogers understood the importance of their pool scene. In 2018, Clemmons told a <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://vtdigger.org/2018/12/25/officer-clemmons-carries-mr-rogers-message-hope/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Vermont news website" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Vermont news website</a>, "It was a definite call to social action on Fred's part. That was his way of speaking about race relations in America." The interaction remains emblematic of the messages of love, kindness, and acceptance that Rogers was trying to share with his show's viewers.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=19 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In 1993, when Clemmons made a last appearance on the show, he and Rogers recreated the pool scene, during which Clemmons sang "Many Ways to Say I Love You." But this time Clemmons didn't just use Rogers' towel — Rogers took the towel and dried Clemmons' feet himself. Clemmons, who saw a connection to Jesus washing his disciples' feet, found the act very moving. As he later said, "I am a Black gay man and Fred washed my feet."</p><img alt="Mister Rogers with Daniel Tiger" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/504951_fred_danieltiger1516300495.jpg title="Mister Rogers with Daniel Tiger" width=2109 height=3179 decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center>Open Gallery<span class="css-1w4f7je es31yw60"><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.biography.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/arrow-right.7440adc.svg alt title="Black right arrow" width=100% height=auto decoding=async role=img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7o7XOoKmaqJiue6S7zGiYnKyfp8Bwucisq56qXae8qLHRrGSonpaesKa%2BjJyjnqWdpLu0ec%2BopqU%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./julian-sands-biography.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Julian Sands  Bio (Wiki) ">&larr;
