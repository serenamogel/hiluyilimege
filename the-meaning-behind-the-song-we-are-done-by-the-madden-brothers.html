After spending the better part of 2010 and 2011 focusing on their pop-punk band “Good Charlotte,” the brothers shifted gears and began working on a new project that focused on a different kind of sound. In 2014, they released their debut album as a duo, “Greetings from California,” which featured hit singles like “We Are Done.” The song, in particular, showcases a very different sound than what we had seen from the brothers in the past, and the lyrics and message also hit close to home for several listeners.</p><p class=ez-toc-title>Table of Contents</p><span class=ez-toc-title-toggle><a href=# class="ez-toc-pull-right ez-toc-btn ez-toc-btn-xs ez-toc-btn-default ez-toc-toggle" aria-label="Toggle Table of Content"><span class=ez-toc-js-icon-con><span><span class=ez-toc-icon-toggle-span></span></span></span></a></span><ul class="ez-toc-list ez-toc-list-level-1 eztoc-toggle-hide-by-default"><li class="ez-toc-page-1 ez-toc-heading-level-1"><a class="ez-toc-link ez-toc-heading-1" href=# title="The Meaning Behind The Song: We Are Done by The Madden Brothers">The Meaning Behind The Song: We Are Done by The Madden Brothers</a><ul class=ez-toc-list-level-2><li class=ez-toc-heading-level-2><a class="ez-toc-link ez-toc-heading-2" href=# title="Verse 1">Verse 1</a></li><li class="ez-toc-page-1 ez-toc-heading-level-2"><a class="ez-toc-link ez-toc-heading-3" href=# title=Chorus>Chorus</a></li><li class="ez-toc-page-1 ez-toc-heading-level-2"><a class="ez-toc-link ez-toc-heading-4" href=# title="Verse 2">Verse 2</a></li><li class="ez-toc-page-1 ez-toc-heading-level-2"><a class="ez-toc-link ez-toc-heading-5" href=# title="Chorus 2">Chorus 2</a></li><li class="ez-toc-page-1 ez-toc-heading-level-2"><a class="ez-toc-link ez-toc-heading-6" href=# title="Verse 3">Verse 3</a></li><li class="ez-toc-page-1 ez-toc-heading-level-2"><a class="ez-toc-link ez-toc-heading-7" href=# title=FAQs>FAQs</a><ul class=ez-toc-list-level-3><li class=ez-toc-heading-level-3><a class="ez-toc-link ez-toc-heading-8" href=# title="1.

The repeated refrain of “we are done” emphasizes the point that the speaker has moved on and is not looking back. The lines “It’s not about who’s right or wrong” suggest that there might have been some conflict or disagreement that led to this outcome, but the speaker is now past that.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Chorus></span>Chorus<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>“And the funny thing is / All I ever wanted / I already had / There’s a picture of us on the wall / You can’t see it cause I know it’s upside down / I don’t want to be living in a world without you”</p><p>The chorus brings up the idea of the speaker being in love with someone who may no longer be in their life. They reminisce about the good times – “all I ever wanted, I already had” – and then bring up a picture on the wall which is upside down. The image of the picture being upside down suggests that things are not as they should be – that the relationship has been turned on its head. The last line shows the speaker’s vulnerability – they don’t want to be without their significant other but may not have a choice.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Verse_2></span>Verse 2<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>“So I’m singing, ooh, ooh, ooh / And the fire’s started in my heart / And we’re burning up, all we ever knew / Go ahead and watch it burn, watch it burn”</p><p>The second verse introduces the idea of the speaker being reborn or reinvented. The line “the fire’s started in my heart” could be interpreted as a metaphor for finding new passion or energy within oneself. The line “we’re burning up, all we ever knew” could mean that they are letting go of old patterns or ways of doing things.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Chorus_2></span>Chorus 2<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>“‘Cause the end, it don’t look pretty / But you can’t say we didn’t try / I’m not talking ’bout your friends / I’m talking ’bout you and I / And we’re all just kids that grew up way too fast / Yeah, the good times, they didn’t last”</p><p>The second chorus acknowledges that the ending of a relationship may not be beautiful, but at least they gave it their all. The line “I’m not talking ’bout your friends, I’m talking ’bout you and I” emphasizes that the relationship is between two individuals, not a group. The line “we’re all just kids that grew up way too fast” could be taken as an acknowledgement that life moves quickly.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Verse_3></span>Verse 3<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>“So if you’re in it for life, then it’s me and you / If you’re in it tonight, then it’s me and you / Where you goin’, where you been, who you with / Baby, it’s me and you”</p><p>The final verse could be interpreted as a plea to the person the speaker is addressing – “if you’re in it for life, then it’s me and you.” This could mean that the speaker is looking for a commitment from the other person. The rest of the lines could be read as the speaker asking for information about where they stand in the other person’s life.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=FAQs></span>FAQs<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=1_Is_%E2%80%9CWe_Are_Done%E2%80%9D_based_on_personal_experience_for_The_Madden_Brothers></span>1.
