He is believed to have garnered his impressive net worth from his previous playing career and perhaps other ventures.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Brandon Staley’s salary</h2><p>Brandon Staley makes $4 million a year with the Los Angeles Chargers. In this elite league, Staley has become one of the highest-paid coaches. Because of his reputation for remaining composed and easygoing in high-pressure situations, Brandon Staley deserves every success he has had in his professional life.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/media.ghgossip.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/21113234/rnmps9zazgbolm2mcyox.webp?resize=420%2C236&ssl=1"><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Brandon Staley’s assets</h2><p>As of the time of filing this report, we have no information regarding the assets and lifestyle of Brandon Staley.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Brandon Staley career</h2><p>At Division III St. Thomas (Minnesota), Brandon worked with defensive linemen and special teams in his first coaching position as a graduate assistant at Northern Illinois from 2006 to 2008.</p><p>For two years, Staley was Hutchinson Community College’s (Kansas) associate head coach and defensive coordinator.</p><p>In 2012, he was a graduate assistant at Tennessee. For the next three seasons (2013, 2015, and 2016) Staley worked for John Carroll University (Ohio) as the defensive coordinator and secondary coach.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/media.ghgossip.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/21113209/download-13-1-1024x683.jpeg><p>In 2014, he worked as James Madison University’s (Virginia) defensive coordinator/linebackers coach. Staley became the outside linebackers coach of the Chicago Bears in 2017.</p><p>Reunited with head coach Vic Fangio, Staley was hired by the Denver Broncos on January 15, 2019, to serve as their outside linebackers coach.</p><p>Wade Phillips was replaced by Staley, the Los Angeles Rams’ new defensive coordinator, on January 16, 2020.</p><p>2020 was Staley’s lone season as coordinator. He led the Rams’ defense to victories in total yards allowed and points scored, establishing himself as a desirable head coach prospect throughout the league.</p><p>In place of Anthony Lynn, Staley was appointed head coach of the Los Angeles Chargers on January 17, 2021. In his first regular-season head coaching game, on September 12, 2021, Staley led the Chargers to a 20–16 victory over the Washington Football Team.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p>After 16 games this season, Staley guided the Chargers to a 9–7 record. But in a win-or-tie or-go-home scenario against the Las Vegas Raiders in Week 18, Staley faced criticism for two plays he made during the contest.</p><p>In the first, the Raiders had a short field and would score to increase their advantage to 12 after the Chargers’ own 18-yard line was the site of a botched fourth down conversion.</p><p>The second was putting the Raiders at the Chargers 39-yard line with 38 seconds remaining in the overtime quarter and calling a timeout. The Raiders were running the ball, and according to Staley, he called the timeout to get the appropriate defensive players on the field.</p><p>After the game, speculation abounded that the Chargers’ timeout had cost them dearly because the Raiders won 35–32 and sent the Chargers out of the postseason picture with a 47-yard field goal that was kicked with the clock running out.</p><p>Rich Bisaccia, the Raiders’ interim head coach, claimed that “the timeout was really irrelevant” while talking about the incident on a podcast. Bisaccia is currently the Packers’ special teams coach.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/media.ghgossip.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/21113146/download-14-1-1024x683.jpeg><p>Staley guided the Chargers to a 10–7 record and second-place finish in the AFC West for the 2022 campaign. After finishing as the fifth-seeded team in the AFC, the Chargers faced the fourth-seeded Jacksonville Jaguars (9–8) on January 14, 2023, in the AFC Wild Card round.</p><p>The Jaguars rallied to win the game 31–30 with a field goal as time ran out, despite the Chargers jumping out to a 27–0 lead. It was the third-biggest comeback in the history of the NFL playoffs.</p><p><strong>Source: <a href=# rel=noopener>www.Ghgossip.com</a></strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qLTGqKqsoaBjsLC5jpupmqaUpLtuv9Oao56xXaOytXnWqKmtoF8%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./rebecca-spicher-net-worth-income-salary-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Rebecca Spicher  Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography, How much money make?">&larr;
