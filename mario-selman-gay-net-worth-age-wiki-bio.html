Videos posted which have over a million views can earn one $10,000- 50,000, which is very much.</p><img aria-describedby=caption-attachment-8137 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebliveupdate.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Mario-Selman-net-worth.jpg alt="Image of Youtuber, Mario Selman net worth is $350,000" width=600 height=492 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p>Mario Selman makes a good amount from his career in social media, and as such, has an estimated net worth of $350k, This is very impressive, especially considering how young he is. We, however, cannot say for sure how much the young man earns from his channel. This much remains a mystery as he has not disclosed that information yet.</p><h2><strong>Is Mario Selman in a Relationship? Is he Gay?</strong></h2><p>Rumors have it the young man, Mario Selman is gay. This is because he has been practically mum on the subject entirely. As a result, the details surrounding his personal life are relatively scarce. The fact that he hasn’t been seen going out on dates with women also fuels this rumor.</p><img aria-describedby=caption-attachment-8138 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebliveupdate.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Mario-Selman-single.jpg alt="Image of Mario Selman is currently single" width=600 height=670 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p>The YouTuber is much more focused on his work and channel than his dating life. This much is clear as we see him continue to thrive on his channel. So we cannot confirm whether Mario Selman is gay or straight, as he has not openly declared to being either. There are also no hints of any person he might be particularly interested in on social media.</p><h2><strong>Mario Selman Age, Family, Wiki, Bio, Facts</strong></h2><table><tbody><tr><td width=319><strong>&nbsp;</strong></td><td width=319><strong>&nbsp;</strong></td></tr><tr><td width=319><strong>Full name</strong></td><td width=319>Mario Selman</td></tr><tr><td width=319><strong>Age</strong></td><td width=319>19 years old.</td></tr><tr><td width=319><strong>Date of Birth</strong></td><td width=319>December 21st, 1999.</td></tr><tr><td width=319><strong>Place of Birth</strong></td><td width=319>Chile</td></tr><tr><td width=319><strong>Profession</strong></td><td width=319>YouTuber</td></tr><tr><td width=319><strong>Net worth</strong></td><td width=319>$ 350,000</td></tr><tr><td width=319><strong>Partner</strong></td><td width=319>Unknown</td></tr><tr><td width=319><strong>Kids</strong></td><td width=319>0</td></tr><tr><td width=319><strong>Nationality</strong></td><td width=319>Chilean- American</td></tr><tr><td width=319><strong>Ethnicity</strong></td><td width=319>Hispanic</td></tr><tr><td width=319><strong>Zodiac Sign</strong></td><td width=319>Sagittarius.</td></tr><tr><td width=319><strong>Parents</strong></td><td width=319>Unknown</td></tr></tbody></table><h3><strong>Summary</strong></h3><p>Find out more about popular YouTuber Mario Selman.
