Bob Ebeling was one of the engineers at the NASA contractor Morton Thiokol who tried to warn their managers and NASA about the problem, but they were overruled. “It's going to blow up,” Ebeling <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2016/01/28/464744781/30-years-after-disaster-challenger-engineer-still-blames-himself data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="told his wife" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">told his wife</a> the night before the launch.

The Teacher in Space program was discontinued.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=30 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Morgan took on the duties of a Teacher in Space designee from March to July 1986, speaking around the country on behalf of NASA. But that fall, she returned home to her teaching job. Twelve years later, NASA asked her back, not as a civilian, but to train to become an astronaut. In August 1998, she started training at Johnson Space Center and became a mission specialist, eventually working in the CAPCOM and robotics branches.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=31 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In August 2007, she finally made it to space on the shuttle Endeavour, becoming the first <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.nasa.gov/sites/default/files/atoms/files/morgan_barbara.pdf data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Educator Astronaut" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Educator Astronaut</a> to reach orbit. “If we don’t take any risks at all, we’re not going anywhere,” she <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.pbs.org/newshour/nation/the-story-of-barbara-morgan-the-first-teacher-in-space data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=said class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">said</a> before the flight. “We teachers encourage our students all the time in the classroom to take some risks.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=32 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Morgan looks back on the positives of the Challenger — and the hope it embodied. “Christa was a great representative of the teaching profession,” she told <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.space.com/10687-challenger-anniversary-barbara-morgan-teacher-space.html data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=Space.com class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Space.com</a>. “Christa reminded everybody, at a time when education was being lambasted, that our country is full of good teachers who are working really hard in the classroom to do the best they can to help our young people have a bright future.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=33 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">The lessons McAuliffe hoped to teach aboard the Challenger are now <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.challenger.org/challenger_lessons/christas-lost-lessons/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="available online" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">available online</a> as part of her Lost Lessons. But perhaps the most valuable lesson she taught was the importance of education, as she famously captured in the words: "I touch the future.
