This may be due to moral issues; as the anime and games progressed, Pokémon became seemingly more human-like. This included displaying individual personalities, human mannerisms, and complex emotions. In most cultures and societies, the idea of human beings eating each other is strictly taboo, so much so that even the idea of fictional creatures eating one another would seem equally cannibalistic if they possessed any human qualities. However, in <a href=# title="Pokémon Sword and Shield">Pokémon Sword and Shield</a>, <a href=# title="Barraskewda (Pokémon)">Barraskewda</a> and <a href=# title="Appletun (Pokémon)">Appletun</a> are both stated to be popular foods for humans.</p><p>Some Pokémon have even been given new dietary habits, possibly in an attempt to downplay any predatory behaviors. An example of this would be <a href=# title="Aerodactyl (Pokémon)">Aerodactyl</a>, which was originally suggested to be <a href=# class=extiw title=wp:carnivore>carnivorous</a>, but is later shown to eat fruit. In the <a href=# title="Original series">original series</a>, Ash's Pokédex states "Its hard fangs suggest it might have been a carnivore. Its sharp claws were probably used to capture prey." Even in the games, Aerodactyl's Pokédex entries mention it tearing the throats out of its enemies. In <i><a href=# title=EP046>Attack of the Prehistoric Pokémon</a></i>, Aerodactyl was even shown going for Ash's throat. However, in <i><a href=# title=HS15>Putting the Air Back in Aerodactyl!</a></i>, the fossilized Aerodactyl egg <a href=# title="Gary Oak">Gary</a> used to resurrect the Pokémon was found near fossilized seed remains. After Aerodactyl escaped, it was only calmed down when fed a pear-like fruit that was a similar DNA match to the seeds. This would imply that Aerodactyl regularly fed on the fruit, implying that it was an <a href=# class=extiw title=wp:herbivore>herbivore</a> or an <a href=# class=extiw title=wp:omnivore>omnivore</a>.</p><h2><span id=Pok.C3.A9mon_droppings></span><span class=mw-headline id=Pokémon_droppings>Pokémon droppings</span></h2><a href=# class=image><img alt src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/archives.bulbagarden.net/media/upload/thumb/7/71/Pidgey_poop_Adventures.png/375px-Pidgey_poop_Adventures.png decoding=async width=250 height=195 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p>According to a few sources, Pokémon, like real-world <a href=# title="Animals in the Pokémon world">animals</a>, do leave their own droppings.</p><h3><span class=mw-headline id=In_the_games_2>In the games</span></h3><h4><span id=Pok.C3.A9dex_entries_2></span><span class=mw-headline id=Pokédex_entries_2>Pokédex entries</span></h4><ul><li>Many farmers cherish and nurture <a href=# title="Diglett (Pokémon)">Diglett</a> because its droppings enrich the soil it lives in.</li><li>The belly patterns of <a href=# title="Poliwag (Pokémon)">Poliwag</a>'s evolutionary line are their insides seen through the skin that get clearer after they eat, alluding to visible feces going through intestines, like what can be seen in real-life <a href=# class=extiw title=wp:tadpole>tadpoles</a>.</li><li>Because <a href=# title="Galarian form">Galarian</a> <a href=# title="Weezing (Pokémon)">Weezing</a> consumes particles that contaminate the air, instead of leaving droppings, it expels clean air.</li><li>Darumaka's droppings are hot, so people used to put them in their clothes to keep themselves warm.</li><li><a href=# title="Turtonator (Pokémon)">Turtonator</a>'s dung is known to be dangerously explosive, presumably due to its habit of eating sulfur, and is put to various use.</li><li>Even though <a href=# title="Guzzlord (Pokémon)">Guzzlord</a> is constantly devouring everything in its way, its lack of droppings is a mystery.</li></ul><h3><span class=mw-headline id=In_the_anime_3>In the anime</span></h3><h3><span class=mw-headline id=In_the_manga_2>In the manga</span></h3><h4><span id=Pok.C3.A9mon_Pocket_Monsters></span><span class=mw-headline id=Pokémon_Pocket_Monsters>Pokémon Pocket Monsters</span></h4><h4><span id=Pok.C3.A9mon_Adventures></span><span class=mw-headline id=Pokémon_Adventures>Pokémon Adventures</span></h4><h3><span class=mw-headline id=In_books>In books</span></h3><h4><span class=mw-headline id=Pocket_Monsters_Encyclopedia>Pocket Monsters Encyclopedia</span></h4><ul><li><a href=# title="Charizard (Pokémon)">Charizard</a>'s capability to fly up 1,400 meters in altitude was theorized after finding droppings, thought to be theirs, mid-level on <a href=# class=extiw title="wp:Mt.
